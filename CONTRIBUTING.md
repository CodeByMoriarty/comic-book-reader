Thanks for taking the time to contribute!

I'm not looking for code contributions, as I want to keep this as a personal project, but bug reports and feature suggestions are always welcome (you can use the [issues section](https://github.com/binarynonsense/comic-book-reader/issues) of the repository to leave feedback), as well as [pull requests](https://github.com/binarynonsense/comic-book-reader/pulls) with new [localization files](https://github.com/binarynonsense/comic-book-reader/tree/master/app/assets/i18n) for other languages, [documentation](https://github.com/binarynonsense/comic-book-reader/tree/master/docs) translations or updates to the currently available ones if they don't have an active maintainer (excluding English and Spanish, which I maintain myself).

If you want to create a localization file for another language, I suggest using the [English one](https://github.com/binarynonsense/comic-book-reader/blob/master/app/assets/i18n/en.json) as a starting point.
