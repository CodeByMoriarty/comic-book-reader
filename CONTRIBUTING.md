Thanks for taking the time to contribute!

I'm not looking for code contributions, as I want to keep this as a personal project, but bug reports and feature suggestions are always welcome (you can use the [issues section](https://github.com/binarynonsense/comic-book-reader/issues) of the repository to leave feedback), as well as [pull requests](https://github.com/binarynonsense/comic-book-reader/pulls) with new [localization files](https://github.com/binarynonsense/comic-book-reader/tree/master/app/assets/i18n) for other languages or [documentation](https://github.com/binarynonsense/comic-book-reader/tree/master/docs) translations. If you want to update already available localization files and/or documents, create an issue to check if they have an active maintainer and talk about the changes you plan to make before creating a pull request.

If you want to create a localization file for another language, I suggest using the [English one](https://github.com/binarynonsense/comic-book-reader/blob/master/app/assets/i18n/en.json) as a starting point.
